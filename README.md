# Image Multi Cropper

Image Multi Cropper was built for my coin collecting hobby, but it was also modified to allow for annotations to be created within an image.  The tool was built with PyQt6 and allows users to crop multiple areas from a single image. Users can select crop areas using the mouse, name each crop, and save all of those cropped areas at once.  I use this functionality to crop multiple coins from an image when taking photos of coin folders.  The application also supports saving annotations in JSON and XML formats.
